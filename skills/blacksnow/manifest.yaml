description:
  short: >
    Detects pre-news ambient risk signals across human, legal, and operational 
    systems and converts them into machine-readable, tradable risk primitives.
  long: >
    BlackSnow is an economic sensor skill that ingests fragmented, low-signal, 
    legally accessible data exhaust from multiple non-obvious domains. It applies 
    ontology alignment, weak-signal Bayesian accumulation, and horizon forecasting 
    to surface early risk vectors before formal events, news, or disclosures occur. 
    Outputs are structured for automated consumption by financial, insurance, 
    logistics, and policy systems.
